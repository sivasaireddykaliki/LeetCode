Given an array of strings words, return the first palindromic string in the array. If there is no such string, return an empty string "".

A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.

 

Example 1:

Input: words = ["abc","car","ada","racecar","cool"]
Output: "ada"
Explanation: The first string that is palindromic is "ada".
Note that "racecar" is also palindromic, but it is not the first.
Example 2:

Input: words = ["notapalindrome","racecar"]
Output: "racecar"
Explanation: The first and only string that is palindromic is "racecar".
Example 3:

Input: words = ["def","ghi"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There are no palindromic strings, so the empty string is returned.
 

Constraints:

1 <= words.length <= 100
1 <= words[i].length <= 100
words[i] consists only of lowercase English letters.

Solution:

class Solution {
    public String firstPalindrome(String[] words) {
        
        String palString="";
        String revStr="";
        int index;
        for(int i=0;i<words.length;i++)
        {
            revStr="";
            index=words[i].length()-1;
            while(index>=0)
            {
                revStr+=words[i].charAt(index);
                index--;
            }
            if(revStr.equals(words[i]))
            {
                palString=revStr;
                break;
            }
        }
        return palString;
    }
}
